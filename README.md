MNIST Handwriting Classifier
Overview

This project demonstrates a handwriting digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. The notebook implements a basic Deep Learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) and predicts them with high accuracy. This project is designed for learning and practicing computer vision and neural network concepts.

Features

Loads and visualizes the MNIST dataset.

Preprocesses data for neural network input.

Builds a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Trains the model and evaluates performance.

Makes predictions on sample images.

Provides clear and reproducible results for educational purposes.

Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, split into:

60,000 training images

10,000 test images

Each image is 28x28 pixels.

Installation

Clone the repository and install required packages:

git clone https://github.com/zeyyildm/mnist-classifier.git
cd mnist-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook mnist_handwriting.ipynb in Colab or locally and run each cell to train and test the model.
You can modify the model architecture or hyperparameters to explore improvements.

Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test set. You can visualize predictions and model performance metrics in the notebook.
